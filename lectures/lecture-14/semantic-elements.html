<!-- Purpose of semantic elements in web development
Semantic elements are HTML tags with a specific meaning and purpose, which helps convey the structure and organization of a web page's content. These elements help browsers and developers understand the layout and importance of different web page sections.

Before HTML5, developers used non-semantic elements like <div> and <span> with class and ID attributes to define the structure and style of a web page. While these elements provided flexibility, they lacked the built-in meaning that semantic features offer.

Using semantic elements:

It makes your HTML code more readable and maintainable for developers.
Improves the accessibility of your website for assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
Enhances search engine optimization (SEO) by providing additional context for search engines to understand your content. -->

<!-- New HTML5 semantic elements: header, footer, section, article, nav, and aside
HTML5 introduced several new semantic elements to better define a web page's structure. Here's an overview of these elements:

<header>: Represents the header or introductory content of a section, typically containing a logo, navigation, or heading.
<footer>: Represents the footer of a section, usually containing metadata, copyright information, or contact details.
<section>: Represents a standalone section or grouping of related content, such as chapters, tabs, or thematic groups of content.
<article>: Represents self-contained content that can be independently distributed or reused, like a news article, blog post, or user comment.
<nav>: Represents a section of navigation links within the current document or other documents.
<aside>: Represents content tangentially related to the content around it, like a sidebar or pull-quote. This content can be considered separate from the main content. -->

<!--  Importance of using semantic elements for accessibility and SEO
Using semantic elements in your web pages is crucial for both accessibility and search engine optimization.

Accessibility:
Screen readers and other assistive technologies use semantic elements to understand and interpret your web page's structure, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and consume content.
Proper use of semantic elements helps developers create a more organized and meaningful structure, which improves the user experience for all visitors.
SEO:
Search engines use semantic elements better to understand the content and structure of a web page.
Semantic elements can help improve your website's search engine ranking and visibility by providing more context and meaning.
Using semantic elements like <article>, <header>, and <nav> makes it easier for search engines to identify and index important content on your website.
In conclusion, using HTML5 semantic elements improves the readability and maintainability of your code and enhances your website's accessibility and search engine optimization. Incorporating these elements into your web development practices allows you to create better-structured, more meaningful, and accessible web pages. -->
