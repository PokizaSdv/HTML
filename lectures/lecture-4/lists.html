<!--  Lists
In HTML, lists are used to group related items in an organized and structured manner. There are two main types of lists in HTML: unordered and ordered. Additionally, a third type called description lists can be used for a slightly different purpose.

Unordered lists (bulleted lists):
Unordered lists use the <ul> tag, which stands for "unordered list."
List items inside an unordered list are created using the <li> tag, which stands for "list item."
By default, unordered lists are displayed as bulleted lists, with each item preceded by a bullet point.
Ordered lists (numbered lists):
Ordered lists use the <ol> tag, which stands for "ordered list."
List items inside an ordered list also use the <li> tag.
By default, ordered lists are displayed as numbered lists, with each item preceded by a number (1., 2., 3., etc.).
The type attribute of the <ol> tag defines the type of the list item marker
type="1" The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)
type="A" The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters
type="a" The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters
type="I" The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers
type="i" The list items will be numbered with lowercase Roman numbers
Description lists
A description list in HTML is a type of list that allows you to define a list of terms and their corresponding descriptions. It is typically used to present a glossary of terms, definitions of technical words, or any other type of list where the term's meaning needs to be explained.

The <dl> element is used to define the list and contains one or more sets of term and description pairs.
The <dt> element is used to define the term being described.
Te <dd> element is used to define the description of the term.
Using lists in HTML helps create well-structured, organized, and easily readable content. Lists also improve accessibility, as screen readers and other assistive technologies use them to provide better navigation and understanding of the content.
