<!-- Basic syntax of HTML, including tags and elements
Element
In HTML, an "element" refers to a specific type of content, such as a button, image, or text. Elements are defined using "tags", which create a starting point and an ending point for the content.

Let's take the "button" element as an example. To create a button in HTML, you would use the following tags:

<button>Click me!</button>

Here, the opening tag is <button> and the closing tag is </button>. Anything you put between these two tags will be treated as content for the button element. In this case, the content is the text "Click me!".

Similarly, the "img" element is used to display an image in HTML. Here's an example of how to create an image element using the "img" tag:

<img src="path/to/image.png" alt="My image">

In this example, the "img" tag creates the image element. The "src" attribute specifies the path to the image file, and the "alt" attribute provides alternative text for the image, which screen readers use for accessibility purposes.

The combination of an opening tag, a closing tag, and the content between them is an HTML element. The opening tag begins the element and the closing tag ends it, while the content between them provides the actual content for the element. -->

<!-- HTML document structure
<!DOCTYPE html>: This line declares the document type and version of HTML being used. In this case, it indicates that the document is an HTML5 document. This declaration helps web browsers render the page correctly.
<html lang="en">: This opening tag starts the HTML document and specifies the language attribute (in this case, "en" for English). The language attribute helps search engines understand the content and improves accessibility for screen readers.
<head>: The opening head tag begins the head section of the HTML document. The head section typically contains meta information, styles, and scripts that are not directly displayed on the web page.
<meta charset="UTF-8" />: This self-closing meta tag defines the character encoding for the HTML document. UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that covers most of the world's languages.
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />: This self-closing meta tag is used for compatibility with Internet Explorer. It instructs the browser to use the latest rendering engine available, improving the rendering of the web page in older versions of Internet Explorer.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />: This self-closing meta tag configures the viewport, which affects how the web page is displayed on different devices. The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to the screen width of the device, and initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level when the page is loaded.
<title>Document</title>: The opening and closing title tags define the web page's title, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. In this case, the title is "Document."
</head>: The closing head tag signifies the end of the head section.
<body>: The opening body tag begins the body section of the HTML document. This section contains the content displayed on the web page, such as text, images, and multimedia.
</body>: The closing body tag signifies the end of the body section.
</html>: The closing HTML tag marks the end of the HTML document.
This code provides a basic HTML5 template with essential meta tags, which can be a starting point for creating a new web page.-->

<!-- Concept of nesting tags and proper indentation   Nesting tags and proper indentation are important concepts in HTML, as they help to create well-structured, organized, and easily readable code. Let's discuss these concepts in more detail:
Nesting tags
Nesting refers to placing one HTML element inside another. This creates a parent-child relationship between elements, defining the structure and hierarchy of the content on the web page. When nesting tags, it's essential to ensure that the opening and closing tags are correctly nested and don't overlap incorrectly, as this can cause rendering issues in browsers.

Proper indentation
Proper indentation makes your HTML code more readable and easier to understand. Indentation helps to visually represent the nesting and hierarchy of elements in the HTML document. It's a good practice to use spaces or tabs to indent nested elements consistently. -->
