<!-- Intro
Welcome to the HTML module of our Fullstack bootcamp! In this module, you will learn the fundamentals of HTML and how to use it to create web pages. HTML is the backbone of every website and provides the structure and content web browsers use to display information to users.

You can access various resources throughout this module, including lectures, assignments, projects, and quizzes. These resources are designed to help you master HTML and develop the skills to create dynamic and engaging web pages.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of HTML and be able to create web pages from scratch. You can structure content using HTML tags, create hyperlinks, add images and videos, and more.

This module consists of several components designed to help you master HTML. These components include lectures, assignments, projects, and quizzes.

Lectures will include reading materials and videos that cover various HTML concepts. These resources will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of HTML.

Assignments are smaller tasks that will help you master individual HTML concepts or a series of related concepts. Completing these assignments will give you practice and help you reinforce your understanding of HTML.

Projects are larger tasks that require you to use all of the concepts covered in the HTML module. These projects are designed to challenge you and help you better understand how HTML works.

We will also have quizzes and multiple-choice questions open during classroom sessions. These quizzes test your knowledge and understanding of HTML and provide immediate feedback on your progress.

So let's get started and dive into the world of HTML! -->

<!--  Purpose of HTML in web development
HyperText Markup Language
The purpose of HTML in web development is to provide a standardized way to structure and present content on the World Wide Web. HTML is the foundation of web pages and web applications, enabling developers to create and organize content in a readable and accessible format.

Here are some key purposes of HTML in web development:

Structuring content: HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to create a hierarchy and organize content on a web page. This structure ensures content is displayed logically and consistently across web browsers and devices.
Formatting and presentation: HTML allows developers to format text and other elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, and multimedia. This helps make web content more visually appealing and easier to read and understand.
Creating hyperlinks: HTML enables the creation of hyperlinks, which connect web pages, forming the basis of the World Wide Web. Links allow users to navigate between different pages, websites, and resources, making the web an interconnected information network.
Enhancing accessibility: By using semantic HTML elements and proper structure, developers can create web pages that are more accessible to people with disabilities. Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on well-structured HTML to interpret and convey content effectively.
Search engine optimization (SEO): Well-structured HTML helps search engines better understand the content of a web page, improving its ranking in search results. Using appropriate tags, such as headings and semantic elements, makes indexing and displaying web pages easier for search engines.
Integration with other technologies: HTML is the backbone of web development and works seamlessly with other web technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive, dynamic, and visually appealing websites and applications.
In summary, the purpose of HTML in web development is to structure and present content on the web in a consistent, accessible, and interconnected manner. It is the foundation for creating web pages, enabling developers to build user-friendly and visually appealing websites and applications. -->

<!--  History and evolution of HTML
The history and evolution of HTML can be traced back to the early days of the World Wide Web. Over the years, it has gone through several versions and improvements, adapting to the changing needs of the web.

Early days (late 1980s - early 1990s): HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), in 1989-1990. He created HTML as a simple markup language to share documents with his colleagues. In 1991, Berners-Lee released the first public version of HTML, which included 18 tags.
HTML 2.0 (1995): As the web started to gain popularity, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) established a working group to standardize HTML. In November 1995, HTML 2.0 was published as an official standard. It included new features, such as forms and tables, to enhance web interactivity and presentation.
HTML 3.2 (1997): The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) took over the development of HTML in 1996. HTML 3.2, released in January 1997, was the first W3C recommendation for HTML. This version introduced new features, such as font, center, and strike elements, and deprecated some elements from earlier versions.
HTML 4.0 (1997) and HTML 4.01 (1999): HTML 4.0, released in December 1997, added support for style sheets (CSS), scripting languages (JavaScript), and multimedia objects. It also introduced the concept of semantic markup and accessibility guidelines. HTML 4.01, a minor update to HTML 4.0, was published in December 1999 and focused on fixing bugs and making the specification more precise.
XHTML (2000): In 2000, W3C introduced XHTML (eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language) as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using XML (eXtensible Markup Language) syntax. XHTML aimed to make HTML more extensible and modular, but it never gained widespread adoption due to its strict syntax requirements and limited browser support.
HTML5 (2014): HTML5, a collaboration between the W3C and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), was published as a W3C Recommendation in October 2014. HTML5 brought significant improvements and new features, such as semantic elements (header, footer, article, etc.), audio and video support, canvas for graphics, and enhanced forms. It also provided better support for mobile devices and modern web technologies.
W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium. It is an international organization that develops standards, guidelines, and best practices for the World Wide Web. The W3C's mission is to ensure the long-term growth, accessibility, and interoperability of the web by creating and maintaining web standards, such as HTML, CSS, and SVG. The consortium is led by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and is made up of member organizations from various industries, including technology, academia, and government.

The "3" in W3C is simply a shorthand notation that represents the three W's in "World Wide Web." It is a common practice to use numbers as abbreviations in names or acronyms, where the number represents the count of repeated letters or words. In the case of W3C, the "3" signifies the three words "World," "Wide," and "Web" in the full name "World Wide Web Consortium."

The evolution of HTML reflects the continuous growth and development of the World Wide Web. With each version, HTML has become more powerful and flexible, allowing developers to create richer and more interactive web experiences. HTML5, the current standard, provides a solid foundation for modern web development and is widely supported by all major browsers. -->
