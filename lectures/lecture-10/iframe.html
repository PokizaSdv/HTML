<!-- Iframe: 
An <iframe> is an HTML element that allows you to embed another HTML document (such as a webpage or an HTML file) within the current HTML document. It creates a "frame" or "inline frame" on the web page, displaying the embedded content.

The <iframe> element is useful when you want to display content from another website or an external HTML file on your web page without copying or modifying the original source. Some common use cases <iframe> include embedding YouTube videos, maps from Google Maps, or displaying third-party widgets on your website.

Here's an example of how to use an <iframe> to embed a webpage.



In this example, we used the following attributes:

src: The URL of the web page or HTML file you want to embed. Replace https://example.com with the actual URL you want to embed.
width and height: Specify the dimensions of the iframe. Replace the values with the desired dimensions.
frameborder: Specifies whether or not to display a border around the iframe. Set it to "0" to remove the border or "1" to display the border.
allowfullscreen: Allows the embedded content to be displayed in full screen mode when set. Remove this attribute if you don't want the embedded content to have fullscreen functionality.
Keep in mind that some websites may disallow embedding their content in iframes due to security or privacy reasons. They can do this by setting the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. In such cases, the iframe will not display the content as intended. -->
