<!-- Emphasis: strong and em
In HTML the <em> and <strong> tags provide emphasis or importance to the specific text within your content. They convey different levels of emphasis and are typically displayed differently by browsers to indicate their purpose.

Emphasis: <em>
The <em> tag indicates that the enclosed text should be emphasized or stressed.
By default, most browsers render text inside a <em> tag in italics, signaling that the text has a different tone or emphasis than the surrounding content.
Example: <p>She had a <em>huge</em> collection of books.</p>

In this example, the word "huge" is wrapped in a <em> tag to emphasize its importance in the sentence. Browsers will typically display the word "huge" in italics.

Strong importance: <strong>
The <strong> tag indicates that the enclosed text has strong importance or significance.
By default, most browsers render text inside a <strong> tag in bold, signaling that the text carries a higher importance level than the surrounding content.
Example: <p>This is a <strong>critical</strong> issue that needs immediate attention.</p>

In this example, the word "critical" is wrapped in a <strong> tag to highlight its importance in the sentence. Browsers will typically display the word "critical" in bold.

While both <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text; they convey different levels of importance. The <em> tag is more suitable for subtle emphasis or stress, while the <strong> tag is used for stronger emphasis or to indicate high importance. Additionally, these tags provide semantic meaning to the text, which can be beneficial for accessibility, as screen readers can interpret and convey the emphasized text appropriately to users with visual impairments.
